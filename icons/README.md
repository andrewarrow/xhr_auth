# Icon Files

This directory needs to contain the following icon files for the Firefox extension:

- `icon-48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon-96.png` (96x96 pixels)

You'll need to create or obtain appropriate icon files and place them in this directory. 
The extension manifest references these files for the browser action icon and extension icon.

Example icon suggestions:
- Create a simple icon representing XHR or HTTP requests
- Use a shield or security-related icon to represent authentication monitoring
- Consider using a network or API-related icon

Place the PNG files directly in this directory with the exact filenames specified above.
